# Monster Fighter

This is my first personal project for boot.dev.
This is a turn based monster fighting game similar to pokemon.

# Monsters 
The different monsters I intend on adding:
- Dragon (poweful monster, but slow with low stamina)
- Golem (Great physical defence and endurance, but slow with no magic to speak of)
- Unicorn (Quick, and has access to healing and buff spells. Not very durable, but has deceptively high physical attack)
- Automaton (All round attacker. Runs on lost technology)
- Slime (Doesn't hit hard, but its large health pool regenerates)
- Phoenix (Fast and strong fire attacks. Even if fragile, it can revive once)
